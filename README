DESCRIPTION

ConnectPy is a simple Connect Four game which supports two player games (human 
versus human) and one player games (human versus computer). Note that in one
player games, the human plays as ) and the computer plays as X. The player may 
choose the difficulty level of the AI, between 1 and 4, where the difficulty 
level corresponds to how many moves the AI looks ahead in the game state. You 
can change game settings both in game or through command line arguments.
